Hi, my name is Batın. I study physics engineering in Turkey. I also draw stuff with code, at least that's how I define it.

I've met with programming at somewhere like 7th grade and since then I always try to learn new technologies to find my true passion. I've learned game development,
backend and frontend development and lastly generative art.

## What I'm doing now

* Studying my classes
* Try to entertain myself with games
* Writing [articles](https://batin.sh/blog) about programming in this website
* Creating [generative art](https://fxhash.xyz/u/Stradi)
* Playing guitar
